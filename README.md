# React Code Playground

React Code Playground is an interactive coding platform that allows users to write, edit, and execute code snippets in real-time. The project is built using `React.js`, `CodeMirror`, `Pusher`, `Node.js`, `Express.js`, with styling handled by `CSS` and `HTML`.

## Features

- **Real-time Code Editing:** Users can write and edit code with instant updates.
- **Live Execution:** Code snippets are executed in real-time for immediate feedback.
- **Collaborative Coding:** Utilizes Pusher for real-time collaboration on code projects.
- **Node.js Backend:** Employs Node.js and Express.js for a robust backend to handle code execution and collaboration.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Designed with a responsive and intuitive user interface.
